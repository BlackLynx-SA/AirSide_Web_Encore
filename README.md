# HTML 5

Recent andvances in the specification of this standard has made this the perfect business layer for presenting a GUI to clients. 

# JavaScript with TypeScript

JavaScript is used to perform logical calculations and HTML manipulation on the client side i.e. on their browser. JavaScript is a powerfull tool, but doesn't provide a structured environment for big systems. We use a JavaScript superset developed by Microsoft called TypeScript.

TypeScript lets you write JavaScript the way you really want to. [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. This feature allows us to provide complex data structures from a development perspective, but compiles down to plain JavaScript so that theres no compatability issues between different browsers.

# CSS 3

[CSS3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients , transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts.
